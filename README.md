## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Olivia, and I'm terrible at introducing myself. Nowadays, I mostly code in C++ for fun, with the occasional Python side project, and Typescript and Kotlin at work.

<!-- I also have the periodic non-coding side quest into gaming ([the factory must grow!](https://www.factorio.com/)) and drawing. I make some cool<sup>in my biased opinion</sup> stuff from time to time. -->

And I don't bite ~~hard~~.
