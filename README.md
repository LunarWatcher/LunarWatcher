### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Olivia, and I'm terrible at introducing myself. Nowadays, I mostly code in C++, but I've been dabbling in VimScript (and Vim9Script), because I can. I also have the periodic non-coding side quest into gaming ([the factory must grow!](https://www.factorio.com/)) and drawing. I make some cool<sup>in my biased opinion</sup> stuff from time to time.

And I don't bite ~~hard~~.
