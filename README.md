### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Olivia, and I'm terrible at introducing myself. Nowadays, I mostly code in C++, with some Python on the side for buildsystem scripts, with the periodic non-coding side quest into gaming ([the factory must grow!](https://www.factorio.com/)) and drawing. I make some cool<sup>in my biased opinion</sup> stuff from time to time.

I some times write some random shit on [my blog](https://lunarwatcher.github.io/posts/). I also lurk around [on Discord](https://discord.gg/bJgdwZJYXY)
